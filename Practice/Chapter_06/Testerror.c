(a) The break statement is used to exit from: 'A for loop'
(b) A do-while loop is useful when we want that the statements within the loop must be executed: 'At least once'
(c) In what sequence the initialization, testing and execution of body is done in a do-while loop? 'intialization, execution of body, testing'
(d) Which of the following is not an infinite loop?
1.  int i=1;
    while(1)
    {
        i++;
    }

2.  for( ; ; );

'3.  int t=0,f;
    while(t)
    {
        f=1;
    }'

4.  int y,x=0;
    do
    {
        y=x;
    }

(e) Which of the following statements is true for the following program?
#include<stdio.h>
int main()
{
    int x=10, y=100%90;
    for(i=1;i<=10;i++);
        if(x!=y);
            printf("x=%d y=%d\n",x,y);
    return 0;
}
'The program will produce output x=10 y=10'

(f) Which of the following statement is true about a for loop used in a C program?
1. for loop works faster than a while loop.
'2. All things that can be done using a for loop can also be done using a while loop.'
'3. for( ; ; ) implements an infinite loop'
4. for loop can be used if we want statements in a loop to get executed at least once.
5. for loop works faster than a do-while loop.
